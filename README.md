# Code-Stack.github.io
Code-Stack team website

The main goal of this project was to develop our team website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We tried to build our team website by creating several linked web pages, using 3 types of files: .html, .css and .js from scratch without using any ready templates or tools except a simple text editor. 
This website is dedicated to our team and contains the following sections:
    1. Introduction of the team
    2. Information about each of the team members
    3. Information about our preparations for the Hour of Code event
    4. Information about our Website project
