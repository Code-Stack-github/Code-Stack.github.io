                    Hour of Code is big community that holds projects every year between 6 and 12 December to improve and encourage coding all around the world. 
                    And this year we have decided to be part of this community and participate in one of its’s projects. 
                    We have discussed about hour of code preparation offline and online environment. 
                    All of us made collaboration and find school for event. 
                    Our event school is Baku Secondary School No.308. 
                    The school situated in Yeni Yasamal district and established in 2007. 
                    This school also had won “The Best Secondary School” competition in 2012-2013. 
                    We decided to choose 8th grade for getting better results and it is estimated that there will be about 25 students in the class while we are teaching. 
                    Also, we searched and made convenient games and study materials for them. 
                    The introduction part and study material will be introduced to students by Nilufer and Khanlar. 
                    Alsu and Raul will help students for solving problems related to registration and games.

                    This website is the product of our teamwork. 
                    In order to create this site, firstly, we came together to find the name and logo of our team. 
                    Then we formed the design of the website, and everyone participated very actively in this task. 
                    We decided to make this website three pages: on the first page, we put an introduction to our team, on the second one, we put the personal information of each member and on the last page, we included our Hour of Code and Website projects. 
                    Moreover, we agreed to make this website in 2 languages (Azerbaijani and English) to make it easy for both local and foreign citizens to read and understand.
                    To implement all these ideas and designs we used Visual Studio Code text editor and our fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge, which we gained by completing Codecademy courses.
                    If you want, you can see our progress in Codecademy by clicking our names below. 
                    The HTML part of the website was written by Raul and Alsu.
                    Then Nilufer and Khanlar managed to make the site look more beautiful by writing the CSS part of it. 
                    In the end, Khanlar made some animations using JavaScript and our site was ready to be seen by all.
